## How I controlled this project

This project was divided into two sprints with 1 week each.
I used Trello to control all task and who was development each task.
- Every task with red labels represent that this task belongs to sprint 1
- Every task with gree labels represent that this task belongs to sprint 2
- Every task with blue labels represent the difficult each task, I used Fibonacci numbers until number 13 to quantify the difficult

I chose don't use back-end to develop it because I hadn't time to develop all that I needed and I hadn't time to develop all the task to see a complete system with gamification.

I didn't make the units and integration test because of the time problem.

This test is very very very far to be good but I tried to make the best with the small time that I had (Christmas party/Holiday)

In each task have more information. Trello link: https://trello.com/b/9UQTWTy6/pixsy-test
